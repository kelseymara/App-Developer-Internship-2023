# AG Grid Learnings and Challenges ðŸ“š

## Learnings
### AG Grid Basics ðŸ“‹
- I gained an understanding of AG Grid's core concepts, including column definitions, row data, and grid options.
- I learned how to configure the grid layout and how to make columns sortable.

### Data Integration with Backend ðŸ“¡
- One of my significant achievements was learning how to fetch data from the backend and seamlessly display it onto the AG Grid.
- I gained hands-on experience in setting up RESTful API calls to retrieve data and efficiently render it within the grid.
- I implemented live data updates by fetching new data every 5 seconds, creating a dynamic and real-time data grid experience.
  
### Dynamic Data Binding ðŸ”—
- I explored techniques to dynamically bind data to custom cell renderers, enabling the grid to render different components based on cell data.

## Challenges
### Contextual Rendering ðŸŽ­
- One challenge I encountered was implementing custom cell renderers that dynamically change their appearance based on specific conditions or data values.
- To address this challenge, I effectively utilized React's built-in useState hook to manage the state within the custom cell renderer component.
- By implementing conditional rendering with if statements, I was able to achieve the desired visual changes in the cell renderer based on different data conditions.
