## Front-end code

## Overview
For my main project, I utilized the AG Grid Component as a replacement for a traditional HTML table, benefiting from its enhanced features and performance. To implement this component, I referred to the official documentation provided by AG Grid (https://www.ag-grid.com/). However, I used TypeScript instead of Javascript, which offered valuable benefits, such as enhanced type safety. 

## File Overview
This folder includes the following files:  

### GridComponent.tsx
The `GridComponent.tsx` file contains the implementation of the AG Grid component. It showcases how to create a grid with sample data and set up basic configurations like column headers and sorting.

### Learnings.md
The `Learnings.md` file contains additional notes, insights, and challenges I've encountered while working with the AG Grid component.

## Conclusion 
Using AG Grid in my project has allowed me to create a dynamic and efficient data grid that enhances the user experience. I've learned how to configure the grid with various features, including sorting, and integrate it into a React application seamlessly.
