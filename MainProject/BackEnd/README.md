# Student Model Backend 🎓
This backend application serves as a sample for managing a "Student" model. 🎓 It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The application includes a models folder containing the schema and a controllers folder containing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for managing student data. 📚

## Project Structure 📁
### Models 🗂️
- **studentModel.ts**: This file includes the Mongoose schema for a student object. The schema defines the attributes and structure of the student model in the database.
### Controllers 🎛️
- **studentCheck.ts**: This file includes the CRUD functions for managing student data. It contains functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting student records.

## Internship Project Comparison 🌟
During my internship, I developed a backend application with a different object, serving a specific purpose. In that project, I focused on building APIs to manage and process data related to that object.

However, for the purpose of this sample application, we are dealing with a "Student" model. 📝 This simple example aims to demonstrate the structure of a typical backend application, facilitating understanding and learning. 🏫
