# Project README - MERN Stack with TypeScript Internship ðŸš€

## Introduction ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to the README for my MERN Stack with TypeScript Internship project! Throughout this experience, I had the opportunity to work on a project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with TypeScript. While I am unable to share all of the exact code from the project due to confidentiality reasons, I am excited to showcase some snippets of the components and functionalities I learned and developed during the internship.

## Folder Structure ðŸ“‚

This project is organized into two main folders:

- FrontEnd: Contains sample code and notes related to the interactive and user-friendly frontend components built using React and TypeScript.
- BackEnd: Contains sample code and nodes for the backend implementation using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, with a focus on CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions.
