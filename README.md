# 🌟 Application Developer Internship Experience - Summer 2023 🌟

## Introduction
👋 Welcome to the repository for my Summer 2023 internship! In this repository, you will find two separate projects that highlight my internship journey.  Please note that due to confidentiality reasons, I am unable to share all of the exact code from the main project. However, I am thrilled to present some code snippets and learning insights from the developed components and functionalities.

## Project Overview
### Main Project - MERN Stack with TypeScript 🚀
During the internship, I had the opportunity to work with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack with TypeScript. The primary objectives of the project were as follows:
- Database Integration: Implementing MongoDB for seamless data storage and retrieval within the application.
- Backend Development: Utilizing TypeScript with Express.js and Node.js to ensure strong typing and enhanced code organization.
- Interactive Frontend Components: Building user-friendly and interactive frontend components using React and TypeScript.
- RESTful API Design: Designing and implementing RESTful APIs with TypeScript to facilitate smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
  
### Sample Registration Form Project 📝
As part of my learning journey, I also created a Sample Registration Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This separate project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in web development fundamentals before diving into the complexities of the main project. 

To explore the main project, navigate to the MainProject/ folder, where you will find the relevant code and documentation. For the Sample Registration Form project, head to the SampleRegistrationForm/ folder.
